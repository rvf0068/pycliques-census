# Connected graph clique-behavior census

This repository classifies **connected, unlabeled, simple graphs** through
order 10. All classifications use a pinned revision of the Python monorepo
[`pycliques-project`](https://github.com/rvf0068/pycliques-project).
The earlier pre-clockwork-fix experiment is retained in Git history; the
current stage framework uses clean, stable directories.

## Codespaces commands

Start once by checking the existing baseline (all connected graphs through
8 vertices, with the **snub disphenoid as the only indeterminate graph**):

```bash
bash scripts/stage.sh baseline
```

Then execute each desired stage with a single command:

| Order | Command | Work performed |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 9 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 9 initial` | Classify all 261,080 connected graphs, bound 30 |
| 9 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 9 c10` | On non-conjecturally-indeterminate inputs, check whether K(G) retracts to the complement of C10 |
| 9 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 9 bound60` | Rerun the usual classifier with bound 60 only on still-indeterminate graphs not conjectured divergent; finish by registering all remaining order-9 surface graphs as conjectural references |
| 10 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 10 initial` | Classify all 11,716,571 connected graphs, bound 30, using the registered order-9 surfaces |
| 10 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 10 c10` | Check K(G) retraction to the complement of C10 on still-indeterminate graphs excluding conjecturally divergent |
| 10 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 10 homotopy` | Compute the homotopy type of **G only** for all still-indeterminate graphs with the current pycombtop API |
| 10 | `bash scripts/stage.sh 10 bound70` | Classify at bound 70 **only** graphs with exact pycombtop type contractible or a wedge of S¹ circles |

Run the stages for each order in order. The 10-vertex initial stage requires
the order-9 surface reference file created automatically by stage `9 bound60`.

Each command is repeatable: an interrupted initial run skips completed
batches; an interrupted later stage skips completed graph records. Do not
change the pinned upstream revision while resuming an active run.

## Working results and detailed records

The two easy-to-find working files at the repository root are:

- [`indeterminate_order_9.txt`](indeterminate_order_9.txt)
- [`indeterminate_order_10.txt`](indeterminate_order_10.txt)

They are automatically updated following each completed stage or partially
completed post-stage run. The file's six columns are the original graph
index, pared order, pared graph6, certificate rule, target status, and target
label. Conditional references stay listed until an independent proof
classifies them. Incomplete computations do not count as proofs of convergence
or divergence.

Each stage has a stable directory with a manifest, per-graph data, and
a summary:

```text
runs/
  baseline-through8-bound30/    # previously validated baseline
  order9/
    initial/
    c10/
    bound60/
  order10/
    initial/
    c10/
    homotopy/
    bound70/
```

Initial census verdicts are immutable: post-stages write new records rather
than overwriting prior results. All records use **original** source indices and
original graph6 for recomputation. The c10 stage stores independently
verified retraction maps. The homotopy stage stores `is_exact`, `is_limited`,
the stated type, and the reason from `pycombtop`. A Betti-only result is
not accepted as a wedge-of-spheres or contractibility certificate.

The last order-9 stage generates
[`config/conjectured_surfaces_order9.tsv`](config/conjectured_surfaces_order9.tsv)
listing the remaining original nine-vertex graphs satisfying
`pycliques.surfaces.is_surface`, with graph6 labels. For the order-10
classifier these are loaded using
`register_reference_graph(graph, status=ReferenceStatus.CONJECTURED, label=graph6)`.
They are never silently treated as proven divergent. This file is pinned
by its checksum in the order-10 initial manifest.

## Save progress

Review results before committing. The new stages do **not** automatically
push to GitHub. For example:

```bash
git add runs/order9/ indeterminate_order_9.txt config/conjectured_surfaces_order9.tsv
git commit -m "Record staged order-9 classification"
git push
```

For order 10, replace `order9` and `indeterminate_order_9.txt` with
`order10` and `indeterminate_order_10.txt`. Some stage paths will not yet
exist; use `git add -A` selectively after inspecting `git status`.
Review `history/bash_history` before committing: interactive shell history
may contain sensitive commands or credentials.

## Provenance and reproducibility

`scripts/stage.sh` is the normal entry point.
`scripts/run_census.sh` remains the low-level initial runner.
`scripts/staged.py` implements the selective stages and maintains the working
indeterminate lists. Each stage records a manifest and uses atomic
per-graph files. `pycliques-project` is pinned by
`config/pycliques_commit.txt`; updating it creates a new experiment rather
than reinterpreting old results.

The original order-9 bound-30 run with a mid-run clockwork fix and its
migration records remains available in the repository's earlier commits,
but is not the source of the new staged census.
